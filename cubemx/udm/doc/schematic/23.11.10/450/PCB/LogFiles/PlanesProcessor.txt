                *** ERROR - Plane data for this hatch cannot be created.
                            The operation to resolve the plane boundaries
                            resulted in the shape(s) disappearing.
                            1. If the plane shape is contained within another
                               plane shape, make sure that the inner shape is
                               not behind the outer plane shape.
                            2. Check Plane Shapes for proper placement
                               and all clearances for proper values.
                            3. Make sure that the Route Border is valid.
